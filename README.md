# Mastermind Simplified

# Prerequisites

Only Python 3!

## Description

This code can only be interacted via tests found in `test_mmind.py`, where the most simple cases for a guess (a turn on which the codecraker tries to guess the pattern from the codemaker) are tested. The pattern is composed of a set of four different coloured pegs. No duplicated pegs are allowed.

## Run tests

```
python test_mmind.py
```
